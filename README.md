# Chatbot using Keras

This project implements a chatbot using deep learning techniques with Keras. The chatbot is designed to understand user intents from text inputs and generate relevant responses, providing a conversational experience for users.

This project focuses on developing a chatbot using Keras, a deep learning framework, to create an interactive conversational agent. 
The chatbot employs advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user intents from text inputs and generate contextually relevant responses. 
The neural network model, designed with layers like Embedding and LSTM, undergoes training using a dataset to learn patterns and optimize response generation. 
The project aims to enhance user interactions by providing personalized and accurate responses, ultimately improving the overall user experience in chatbot-based applications. 
Integration of the trained model into various platforms or applications allows for seamless deployment and utilization of the chatbot's capabilities across different use cases and domains.


## Features

- **Intent Recognition:** The chatbot recognizes user intents from input text using a neural network model.
- **Response Generation:** Based on the recognized intent, the chatbot generates contextually relevant responses.
- **Model Architecture:** The neural network model includes layers like Embedding, LSTM, or Dense for text processing and pattern recognition.
- **Training and Evaluation:** The model is trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and performance.
- **Integration:** The trained chatbot model can be integrated into various platforms or applications for interactive use cases.
